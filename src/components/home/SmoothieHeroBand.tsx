// The first thing on the page is a question, not a banner.
//
// The campaign artwork still runs directly underneath; this sits above it
// because the one thing this shop has that a marketplace does not is somebody
// to ask. Typing here hands the question straight to the full-screen chat,
// so the first message is the shopper's own words rather than a greeting they
// have to reply to.
//
// The wordmark behind it is decoration, drawn once at a size that runs off
// both edges and clipped by the band. It is aria-hidden and unselectable: a
// screen reader announcing "Smoothlife.com" between the header and the
// heading is noise, and a cursor dragging across the headline should not
// highlight a word nobody can see.
